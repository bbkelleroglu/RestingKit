///
/// `RestingClient` is the core class of `RestingKit`. It allows sending requests
/// and receiving their responses as promises through a high-level API.
///
/// The `RestingClient` is configured with the following components:
///
///  - `baseUrl`: The base URL of the server we want to connect. One client can only connect to a single base URL.
///     Therefore, if you wish to use multiple APIs, you should use different clients for each of them.
///  - `decoder`: The decoder to use for decoding responses.
///  - `requestConverter`: The converter to use for converting `RestingRequest`s to `HTTPRequest`s.
///  - `interceptors`: The interceptors to run for each request and response.
///  - `httpClient`: The client responsible for sending the request and receiving its response.
///
/// There are two function families within the class: `perform(_:)` and `upload(_:)`, each with several
/// overloads for convenience. Even though they do the same thing in the core, The way to achieve their goal is
/// different. `perform(_:)` sends the request by loading the request body into memory, while `upload(_:)` streams
/// the body from a file without loading it. `upload(_:)` also allows tracking upload progress. For most requests
/// `perform(_:)` should be good enough, but for cases when the request body is expected to be large, `upload(_:)`
/// should be preferred.
///
/// The process within a `RestingClient` is the following:
///
/// 1. The request converter converts the `RestingRequest` into an `HTTPRequest`.
/// 2. The interceptors are run with the produced `HTTPRequest` in the order provided.
///    At this point, one of the interceptors might decide to modify the request or stop the execution
///    chain by returning a response or and error.
/// 3. If the interceptors doesn't block the chain, the `HTTPClient` is called to perform the actual request.
/// 4. The response from `HTTPClient` is passed to the interceptors. At this point, an interceptor might decide
///    to change the response or recover from an error.
/// 5. The response is then converted into an `HTTPResponse` by decoding the response body.
///
/// Cases when request promises might fail:
///
/// 1. The encoding of the request has failed.
/// 2. The decoding of the response has faied.
/// 3. Networking errors.
/// 4. The response status was not 2xx.
/// 5. An interceptor decided to raise an error.
